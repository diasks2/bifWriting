## BiF Writing

**A personalized learning writing and writing analysis courseware to support mastery of the CCSS literacy standards**

BiF Writing will at a minimum provide the following quantitative feedback:
- Student time to produce a given writing passage
- Number of paragraphs
- Number of sentences
- Number of words
- Number of characters
- Average length of sentence (# of words)
- Average length of a paragraph (# of sentences)
- Frequency (using our corpus) of words used in the passage
- Originality score (compare words used to other users)
- Number of repeated words in the passage
- POS breakdown - number of nouns, verbs, etc.

Goal: See if it is possible to identity certain quantitative heuristics that can impart some data as to the quality of the writing.

### Eleven Elements of Effective Adolescent Writing Instruction
Source: **WritingNext**  
*Effective Strategies to Improve Writing of Adolescents in Middle and High Schools* (By Steve Graham and Dolores Perin)

1. **Writing Strategies**, which involves teaching students strategies for planning, revising, and editing their compositions  
2. **Summarization**, which involves explicitly and systematically teaching students how to summarize texts  
3. **Collaborative Writing**, which uses instructional arrangements in which adolescents work together to plan, draft, revise, and edit their compositions  
4. **Specific Product Goals**, which assigns students specific, reachable goals for the writing they are to complete  
5. **Word Processing**, which uses computers and word processors as instructional supports for writing assignments  
6. **Sentence Combining**, which involves teaching students to construct more complex, sophisticated sentences  
7. **Prewriting**, which engages students in activities designed to help them generate or organize ideas for their composition  
8. **Inquiry Activities**, which engages students in analyzing immediate, concrete data to help them develop ideas and content for a particular writing task  
9. **Process Writing Approach**, which interweaves a number of writing instructional activities in a workshop environment that stresses extended writing opportunities, writing for authentic audiences, personalized instruction, and cycles of writing  
10. **Study of Models**, which provides students with opportunities to read, analyze, and emulate models of good writing  
11. **Writing for Content Learning**, which uses writing as a tool for learning content material  

### The Recommendations

*The Benefits of Formative Assessment* (by Steve Graham, Karen Harris, Michael Hebert)

1.) USE FORMATIVE WRITING ASSESSMENT TO ENHANCE STUDENTS’ WRITING

- **Provide Feedback.** Writing improves when teachers and peers provide students with feedback about the effectiveness of their writing.
- **Teach students how to assess their own writing.** Writing improves when students are taught to evaluate the effectiveness of their own writing.
- **Monitor students' writing progress.** Writing improves when teachers monitor students’ progress on an ongoing basis.

2.) APPLY BEST PRACTICES FOR ASSESSING WRITING IN THE CLASSROOM

- **Allow students to use the mode of writing in which they are most proficient when completing a writing assessment.** Writing improves when students are assessed in the format with whichthey are most experienced—pencil and paper, or word processing.
- **Minimize the extent to which presentation forms such as handwriting legibility or computer printing bias judgments of writing quality.** Writing assessment improves when teachers judge the quality of student writing and do not allow factors such as handwriting or computer printing to bias their judgment.
- **Mask the writer's identity when scoring papers.** Writing assessment improves when teachers do not allow their knowledge of who wrote a paper to influence their judgment.
- **Randomly order students' papers before scoring them.** Writing assessment improves when teachers score papers randomly rather than allow a previous paper’s score to influence their judgment.
- **Collect multiple samples of students' writing.** Writing assessment improves when teachers assess students’ writing in a variety of genres. This finding supports the decision by the authors of the Common Core State Standards Initiative to emphasize students’ mastery of many different types of writing, since writing is not a single generic skill.
- **Ensure that classroom writing assessments are reliably scored.** Writing assessment improves when teachers use procedures for ensuring that particular aspects of writing, such as quality and its basic attributes, are measured reliably.
